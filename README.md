A space invaders clone made with VHDL in Vivado for the artix-7 fpga.

You can get "powerups" by increasing your score, which in this case is by killing enemies.

The powerups are faster player speed and faster bullet speed.

The enemy gets faster when the running light hits an edge.

You lose health when the enemy gets past you, and die if all lives are lost (you have 9 lives at the beginning).

If you die you can restart with the btnu (up button).
